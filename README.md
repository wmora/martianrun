**Please, DO NOT publish this same game to Google Play. Use it as a blueprint for your game development**

## Features
* Runs on Android and desktop
* On Android, uses [Google Play Game Services](https://developers.google.com/games/services/) and
[AdMob](https://www.google.com/admob/)

## Setup
You need to add the following string resources to your Android project in order for the module to
compile:

```xml

    <!-- Google Analytics: Replace placeholder ID with your tracking ID -->
    <string name="ga_trackingId">UA-XXXXXXXX-X</string>

    <!--
        App ID generated by Google Play Game Services. Replace placeholder ID with yours
    -->
    <string name="app_id">XXXXXXXXXXX</string>

    <!--
        Google Play Game Services IDs (achievements, leaderboards). These are the IDs configured
        for this particular game and you don't need to set any values for them. For your game you
        would have your own achievements, leaderboards, quests and put those strings instead
    -->
    <string name="achievement_getting_started"></string>
    <string name="achievement_like_a_rover"></string>
    <string name="achievement_spirit"></string>
    <string name="achievement_curiosity"></string>
    <string name="achievement_5k_club"></string>
    <string name="achievement_10k_club"></string>
    <string name="achievement_25k_club"></string>
    <string name="achievement_50k_club"></string>
    <string name="achievement_10_jump_street"></string>
    <string name="achievement_100_jump_street"></string>
    <string name="achievement_500_jump_street"></string>
    <string name="leaderboard_high_scores"></string>

    <!-- Google AdMob Unit ID. Place your ad unit ID here -->
    <string name="ad_unit_id"></string>
```
